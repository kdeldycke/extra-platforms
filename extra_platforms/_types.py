"""Custom types used across the package.

Inspired by `how tomllib does it in the stdlib
<https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/tomllib>`_.

.. hint::
    These type are designed to be imported as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        TYPE_CHECKING = False
        if TYPE_CHECKING:
            from typing import Sequence, ...

            from ._types import _TPlatformRef, _TNestedReferences, ...

    `Mypy is able to pick them up correctly
    <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#python-version-and-system-platform-checks>`_
    because ``TYPE_CHECKING`` is always evaluated to ``False`` at runtime, and to
    ``True`` `during static analysis
    <https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/6aa44da/mypy/reachability.py#L152>`_.
