"""Architecture definitions and metadata.

.. hint::
    Architecture's canonical IDs are inspired by those `used in the auditwheel
    <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/main/src/auditwheel/architecture.py>`_
    project to encode the `manylinux policies
    <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/6.6.0/src/auditwheel/policy/manylinux-policy.json>`_.

.. seealso::
    Architecture variants from `Rust's target-lexicon
    <https://docs.rs/target-lexicon/latest/target_lexicon/enum.Architecture.html#variants>`_.

.. todo::
    Add mapping of architecture to manylinux Python targets? As per:

    - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv-platform-tags/src/platform.rs
    - https://github.com/pypa/manylinux
